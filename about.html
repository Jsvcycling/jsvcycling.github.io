<p>Hi there, I'm Josh Vega, a second year computer science student at the New
  Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). I am also pursuing a minor in
  Mathematical Biology (with a focus on neuroscience) and would like to attend
  graduate school in order to earn a doctorate in computer science.</p>

<p>Outside of computers, I enjoy reading (especially science fiction), playing
  soccer, cycling, and tapping on the piano or strumming the guitar. I also
  enjoy the outdoors and camping and earned the Boy Scouts of America's Eagle
  Scout award in 2014.</p>
