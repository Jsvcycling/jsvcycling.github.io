<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  I'm a computer scientist and software engineer who enjoys using computers to
  solve problems both big and small. While I have some experience in web
  development, systems and application development is where I find myself most
  engaged. In my free time, I enjoy playing recreational soccer and I'm a
  supporter of the New York Red Bulls and FC Barcelona. I also enjoy reading
  regularly and have been attempting to teach myself to play the guitar with
  some success.

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>
  Currently, I'm a student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology where I'm
  completing my B.S. in Computer Science (December 2018). In January 2019, I
  will begin my M.S. in Computer Science with an expected graduation date of May
  2020. I'm also pursing a minor in Applied Mathematics for which I've taken
  multiple methematical biology elective courses. Although a minor is not
  offered by NJIT, I've decidedly taken a number of psychology-focused
  electives, something I find to be very interesting.x

<h3>Work Experience</h3>

<p>
  Since April 2017, I've worked at the NJIT Center for Solar-Terristrial
  Research (CSTR) as an undergraduate research assistant with Dr. Nathaniel
  Frissell and as a member of the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation
  (HamSCI) organization. I focused on developing an efficient method of
  simulating high-frequency (HF, 3-30 MHz) over-the-horizon radio transmissions
  from a transmitter to a receiver. I've presented my work at several
  conferences and I have been a co-author on two peer-reviewed publications that
  utilized the results of the simulation.
